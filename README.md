# Flight-Project
A website simulating a flight-scheduling tool.

In order to use this project, you need to have MySQL downloaded. You first need to create the database by running `schema.sql`.

This project uses **Java Server Pages**. You must use **Eclipse IDE for EE developers**. Open the `loginPage` folder as a new project.

Furthermore, you also need to have [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) installed. Once that's done, go back to Eclipse and select the following:

>Windows - Preference - Server - Runtime Environment - Add - Apache Tomcat v8.0 or
Eclipse- Preferences - Server - Runtime Environments - Add - Apache Tomcat v8.0

Finally, to actually run the website, do the following steps:

>Right click on the project - Run as - Run on Server - Apache â€“ Tomcat8

And you should be good to go!
